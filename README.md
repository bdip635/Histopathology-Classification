# Histopathology-Classification

This work aims at classifying liver cancer from histopathology images into different grades. A robust model is developed in terms of complexity and accuracy for the classification problem. 

We built upon the LiverNet architecture and modified the ASPP module, and achieved improved accuracy on KMC liver data and the publicly available TCGA-LIHC dataset.
